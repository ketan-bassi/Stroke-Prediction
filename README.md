# Stroke-Prediction

## Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Almost 30% of adults younger than 45 don't know the five most common symptoms of a stroke, according to new research. At the same time, stroke is on the rise in that age group.
Each year, 10% to 15% of the nearly 795,000 people in the United States who have a stroke are between the ages of 18 and 45. And despite a decline in the general population, stroke rates – and hospitalizations for it – have increased by more than 40% among younger adults in the past several decades.

## Importance and the goal

Through this dataset we will be analysing what are the key factors responsible to cause stroke in an individual. If we are able to make predictions and analyse the factors that cause stroke it will help doctors in analysing and diagnosing patients more effectively.

## Formalizing problem into data mining task

This information will be used to create a Logical regression model that can be used by doctors to make patients aware on what precautions they can take to minimize their chances of stroke.
